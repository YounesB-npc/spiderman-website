    <p class="p1">
        Spider-Man is a superhero in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee
        and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the
        Silver Age of Comic Books. Considered one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes, he has
        been featured in comic books, television shows, films, video games, novels, and plays.
    </p>
    <p class="p2">
        Spider-Man has the secret identity of Peter Benjamin Parker. Initially, Peter was depicted as a teenage
        high-school student and an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents,
        Richard and Mary Parker, died in a plane crash. Lee, Ditko, and later creators had the character deal with the
        struggles of adolescence and young adulthood and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J.
        Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and enemies
        such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, Peter gets his superhuman spider
        powers and abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. These powers include superhuman strength,
        speed, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability, coordination, and balance; clinging to surfaces and ceilings like
        a spider; and detecting danger with his precognition ability called "spider-sense". He builds wrist-mounted
        "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design, which he uses both for fighting and
        travel, or "web swinging" across the city. Peter Parker initially used his powers for personal gain, but after
        his Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that he could have stopped but did not, Peter began to use his powers to
        fight crime as Spider-Man.
    </p>
    <p class="p3">
        Before Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated
        to the protagonist's sidekick role. The Spider-Man comic series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a high
        school student from the Queens borough of New York City, as Spider-Man's secret identity, whose "self-obsessions
        with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to which young readers could relate.[10] While
        Spider-Man was a quintessential sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes Bucky Barnes and Robin, Spider-Man had no
        superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he had learned the lesson for himself that "with great power
        comes great responsibility" â€”a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man's origin
        story, but later retroactively attributed to the late Uncle Ben Parker.
